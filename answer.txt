What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project? 


The gitignore file deliberately ignores all the untracked files in the java project.


These are the the things included in the Java project - 




	# Compiled class file
	

	*.class
	

	

	

	# Log file
	

	*.log
	

	


	

	# BlueJ files
	

	*.ctxt
	

	


	

	# Mobile Tools for Java (J2ME)
	

	.mtj.tmp/
	

	


	

	# Package Files #
	

	*.jar
	

	*.war
	

	*.nar
	

	*.ear
	

	*.zip
	

	*.tar.gz
	

	*.rar
	

	

	

	# virtual machine crash logs, see http://www.java.com/en/download/help/error_hotspot.xml
	

	hs_err_pid*
	

So these are the files which have to be ignored in the java project.


What does fast-forward in Git mean?


Git fast-forward means that we update the HEAD pointer without merging any commits in a such a way that its new value is a descendant of the prior values. 




Why should you have different branches? 


We should have different branches so that multiple people can work on the same files of the given project and avoid merge conflicts.


In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?


We can have several git repositories of a project which is either read only or read/write.
